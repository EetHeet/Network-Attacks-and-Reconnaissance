First to install evilginx we need to intall golang

First we download it

Then we extract the package

Then we move the folder to `usr/local/go`
Then we add the binary to the PATH enviroment variable `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`
Finally we refresh the shell `source ~/.zshrc`

Now that go is installed we can install evilginx

First we clone the github repository

Then we can just move into the folder and use the Makefile

And now the program is in the build folder

Then we can just run it

But since we don't have any phishlets yet the program just stops

For the next demonstration i use this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evc7C1sGujw

I used a website login page from here https://github.com/villaroot/PHP-Login-Site and set it up in a server virtual machine

Then i used a phishlet from the same repo that i got the login site from and se it up

I enabled it and made the lure
